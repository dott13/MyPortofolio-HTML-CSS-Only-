# MyPortofolio-HTML-CSS-Only-

This Portofolio was made for certificate at freeCodeCamp.org, but later modified to be an example of what I can regarding Front-End development in HTML and CSS

---

## HTML

In this **index.html** file we worked with many ordinary tags including _sections, divs, icona, lists, nav, and etc._ We used theme to make a good work-flow for our document and also we marked the classes from the beginning to know what to use and how in **CSS**.

## CSS

In our **styles.css** file we made many stylistic choices that added a lot of variety to our colors and other aspects of our document. We made a bunch of animations that workeed beautifully in our document using _keyframes, transitions and transforms_ so the document will have it's own distinctive style.

## What does our Document contain?

Our document is made out of 3 sections all of which describe something particular. The **About Me** section contains information about who am I in particular. **Projects** section has some particular projects I worked with.(More will be added with time) **Contact Me** section contains all my contacts that you or anyone interested can access and contact me.
